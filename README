qt-sqlcipher

builds sqlcipher a qsqldriver.

shamelessly borrowed from https://github.com/sijk/qt5-sqlcipher, the difference here is

- couple of qt source files are copied in so the whole qt repo doesn't have to be cloned
- assumes qt and sqlcipher libs/headers already installed


on Arch:

yaourt -S sqlcipher
cd path/to/build
qmake path/to/source
make
sudo make install
